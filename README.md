# Intro to Systems and Networks Programming Challenge 2

**Objective:** Create a program that obtains the current time from both NTP (Network Time Protocol) and the local computer, then prints both times and calculates the difference between them. 

**Summary:** This challenge helps to understand time synchronization mechanisms and the potential time difference between local system time and an externally synchronized time source like NTP. 

*Note: This code was written and tested on Mac and the directions are written based on that.* 

**Directions:**
    <ul>
    <li> Clone the Directory from the terminal: </li>
        **```git clone https://github.com/IamPoojaP/Intro-S-N-Programming-Challenge-3.git```**
    <li>Type **```make```** in the terminal </li>
    <li>**```./Time_in_a_bottle```** to run it</li>
    </ul>
